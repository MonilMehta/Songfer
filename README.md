## üßë‚Äçüíª About

**songfer** was born from a simple idea:  
> _"Music should be accessible, beautiful, and yours to keep‚Äîwithout hassle or compromise."_

Created by [Monil Mehta](mailto:monilmehta5@gmail.com) after realizing there was no simple solution to download entire playlists from YouTube, songfer is a celebration of open-source, music, and community.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Paste a YouTube or Spotify URL**
   - Supports tracks, albums, and playlists.
2. **Pick Your Format**
   - MP3 or AAC, always high quality.
3. **Download & Enjoy**
   - Tracks are tagged, zipped (if playlist), and delivered with cover art.
4. **Explore Your Dashboard**
   - See your stats, get recommendations, and manage your music.

**Technical Magic:**
- **Redis Caching:** Lightning-fast response times by caching frequent queries and results
- **Task Queue Management:** Background processing of downloads using Redis and Celery
- **Parallel Processing:** Downloads album tracks simultaneously for much faster delivery
- **Smart Resource Management:** Efficient handling of large playlists without overloading the server
